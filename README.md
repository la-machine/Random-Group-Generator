# Random-Group-Generator
The Random Group Generator is a Python application built using Tkinter, a popular GUI toolkit. This application allows you to enter the number of people in the list, a list of names and specify the number of groups you want to divide them into. It then randomly assigns the names to the groups and displays the results.
